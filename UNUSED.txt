UNUSED FILES IN PROJECT
=======================

These files are not imported or used anywhere in the active codebase.
They appear to be leftover template files or components that were replaced.

COMPONENTS (Not imported anywhere):
------------------------------------
components/ExpenseList.tsx
components/SettingInput.tsx
components/SettingsRow.tsx

UI COMPONENTS (Template files, not used):
------------------------------------------
components/ui/collapsible.tsx
components/ui/icon-symbol.tsx
components/ui/icon-symbol.ios.tsx

HOOKS (Template files, not used):
----------------------------------
hooks/use-color-scheme.ts
hooks/use-color-scheme.web.ts
hooks/use-theme-color.ts

CONSTANTS (Template files, not used):
--------------------------------------
constants/theme.ts

REDUX ACTIONS (Not dispatched anywhere):
-----------------------------------------
redux/actions/categoryActions.ts

NOTE: categoryReducer, categoryTypes are still used in the Redux store setup,
but categoryActions exports (addCategory, updateCategory, deleteCategory)
are never dispatched. Categories use DEFAULT_CATEGORIES from types/Category.ts.

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
These files can be safely deleted if they're not needed for future features.
The project uses default categories defined in types/Category.ts and doesn't
support adding/editing/deleting categories at runtime.
